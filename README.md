# SurfShop

## Purpose
Surfshop got started with a local Santa Monica Surfboard builder. Because he makes all of the surfboards custom in his backyard, he can accept some custom design input for the surfboards. With my love for 3D development and 3D modeling, I got to work making a surfboard configurator. I began by making a 3D replica of one of the latest board shapes in blender. Using React Three Fiber I imported the model into a scene and applied some color customization with Leva. Currently, I am building 3D models for the other boards and I will be adding more configuration options. The goal is to provide the user with all the different color schemes, shapes, and fin placement options while building their custom board.
